## Hollywood Handshakes

### Who?

I am Sebastian Zapata, a software developer focusing on frontend development.
I am experienced in:
* UI, API & unit tests using frameworks such as Jest, Enzyme & Selenium
* Creating & maintaining APIs
* Creating wireframes & mockups, showing these to clients and then transforming them into components & containers with React
* Using Redux for state management
* Git and branching strategies
* Platform work and build pipelines

### What?

This project is a collection of all of the handshakes that Paul Hollywood has given to contestants across all seasons of the Great British Bake Off.

### Why?

As season 9 started, it became apparent that these handshakes were being given out far too frequently. 
There wasn't a place where it was clear how many had been given out and when, so I decided that I would create such a place, partly for fun, partly for learning and partly for documentation of the handshakes.
